How to run the program:
To properly have the server installed, please click on the following link and following the instructions called "Building a node-box"
https://github.com/ProfAvery/node-box

While in Git Bash, be sure to clone the repository in the node-box/shared folder using the following link.
https://github.com/ImWayGooderest/Poker-Project-CPSC-452

To run the server on git bash type in "node server" while in the same directory as where you cloned the project. If a message pop ups saying "Pker Project app listening on port 3000!" pops up, then the server is up and running. Then you may procede to running two client programs for both players. Enjoy! :*)
